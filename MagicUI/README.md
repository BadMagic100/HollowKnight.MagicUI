# MagicUI

A core mod for Hollow Knight that takes all the fuss of dealing with GameObjects behind the scenes,
allowing mod authors to seamlessly create in-game UIs for their mod with an easy-to-use hierarchical
layout system heavily inspired by WPF.

## Planned features

* Layout & component system, with no gameobjects (but you can access them if you really want to)
* Various layouts (stack layout, a couple flavors of grid)
* Various useful components (text input, text output, button, image, geometry primitives i.e. colored rectangles/lines)
* Some behavior utilities e.g. show UI only on pause screen, hotkey listeners where you just define the key combo and corresponding action
